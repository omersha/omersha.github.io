I'm Omer, jack of some trades. 

I mostly enjoy tinkering with ideas that lie in the intersection of software engineering and theoretical mathematics, and the posts here are likely to reflect that.
A special attention will be given to machine learning and data analysis, which I practice professionally.
Hopefully, you will find some of it interesting or useful.

Feel free to write me regarding any non-spamish matter.
